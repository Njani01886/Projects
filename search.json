Graduation:: Feb 2024 Master of Science Concentration: Data Analytics and Computational Social Science Current GPA: 3.89 Relevant Courses: Advanced Quantitative Methods, Regression Models, Text as Data, Advanced Data-Driven Storytelling\nUniversity of Rhode Island, College of Arts and Sciences, Kingston, RI. Graduated:: May 2022 Bachelor of Science Concentration: Data Science Final GPA: 3.52, Dean’s List: 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022 Relevant Courses: Machine Learning, Multivariate Statistical Learning, Big Data Analysis, Database Management\n\n\nSkills\nGeneral Skills: Data Analysis, Machine Learning, Data Visualization, Data Storytelling, Data Cleaning, NLP\nProgramming Languages: Python, R, and SQL\nLibraries: Ggplot2, Tidyverse, Summarytools, Stats, Tidytext, Quanteda, Rselenium, Lubridate, Devtools, SciPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, Numpy, Pandas\n\n\nProjects\nU.S. Job Satisfaction: Impacts of Technology, Work Environment, and Covid-19 September-December 2023\n\nInvestigated if the move to more work from home and more use of technology at work post-COVID actually lead to any significant changes in job satisfaction using data from the 2018 and 2022 versions of the General Social Survey.\nDeveloped two ordered logit GLMs using the MASS package in R: one main effect model and one interaction model\nCalculated predicted probabilities of job satisfaction for all significant variables (p <0.05) using ggpredict() and graphed them with 95% confidence intervals using ggplot().\nDiscovered that people who never work from home are significantly less likely to to be very satisfied with their job than people who mainly WFH (p <0.05), with all variables held constant.\n\nLink to paper: U.S. Job Satisfaction: Impacts of Technology, Work Environment, and Covid-19\nIdentifying Sources of Poor Nutrition for Americans, Amherst, MA July-August 2023 Project Owner -
