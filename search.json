Graduation:: Feb 2024 Master of Science Concentration: Data Analytics and Computational Social Science Current GPA: 3.89 Relevant Courses: Advanced Quantitative Methods, Regression Models, Text as Data, Advanced Data-Driven Storytelling\nUniversity of Rhode Island, College of Arts and Sciences, Kingston, RI. Graduated:: May 2022 Bachelor of Science Concentration: Data Science Final GPA: 3.52, Dean’s List: 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022 Relevant Courses: Machine Learning, Multivariate Statistical Learning, Big Data Analysis, Database Management\n\n\nSkills\nGeneral Skills: Data Analysis, Machine Learning, Data Visualization, Data Storytelling, Data Cleaning, NLP\nProgramming Languages: Python, R, and SQL\nLibraries: Ggplot2, Tidyverse, Summarytools, Stats, Tidytext, Quanteda, Rselenium, Lubridate, Devtools, SciPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, Numpy, Pandas\n\n\nProjects\nU.S. Job Satisfaction: Impacts of Technology, Work Environment, and Covid-19 September-December 2023\n\nInvestigated if the move to more work from home and more use of technology at work post-COVID actually lead to any significant changes in job satisfaction using data from the 2018 and 2022 versions of the General Social Survey.\nDeveloped two ordered logit GLMs using the MASS package in R: one main effect model and one interaction model\nCalculated predicted probabilities of job satisfaction for all significant variables (p <0.05) using ggpredict() and graphed them with 95% confidence intervals using ggplot().\nDiscovered that people who never work from home are significantly less likely to to be very satisfied with their job than people who mainly WFH (p <0.05), with all variables held constant.\n\nLink to paper: U.S. Job Satisfaction: Impacts of Technology, Work Environment, and Covid-19\nIdentifying Sources of Poor Nutrition for Americans, Amherst, MA July-August 2023 Project Owner - Analyzed the impact of food sources on food and nutrient intakes for different ages and income levels using 2017-18 Food and Nutrient Density by Food Source and Demographic Characteristics datasets - Created multiple charts that visualized the 3 way associations between food source, demographics and food/nutrient density using\nggplot2 in R - Discovered that adults and seniors were consuming more cholesterol at restaurants than at home, low and middle income individuals had lower intakes of protein at home than away from home - Cleaned and combined datasets using the tidyverse package in R in order to produce visualizations - Explained methods and results using language that a non-technical audience could understand in a 29 page report\nLink: Identifying Sources of Poor Nutrition for Americans\nFixing Social Media Design Brief February-May 2023 Team Member -

Developed and tested 4 machine learning models using different regression methods to explore which one performs the best at predicting NBA players’ salaries using R and Python - Found that Random Forest performed the best out of all methods, yielding a low RMSLE of 0.50 - Pre-processed and wrangled data into a suitable format for the ML models - Tuned hyperparameters for each model using GridSearchCV with 5 folds to control for overfitting - Presented my work at my program’s research symposium in front of faculty and peers\nLink: NBA Salary Prediction\nGoals in Soccer Regression Models Project, Amherst, MA November-December 2022\nTeam Member - Investigated the difference in total goals across Europe’s top 5 soccer leagues using team data from the 2021-22 season to understand if the type of league determines the number of goals per season - Developed a Quasi-Poisson regression model with 9 predictors using R with 3 student colleagues - Concluded that there was a significant difference in goals between Bundesliga and other leagues - Handled the the selection of predictors by creating and analyzing a scatter-plot matrix using GGally - Coordinated weekly group discussions with team members on Zoom and in person\nLink: Goals in Soccer\nAssessing Sentiment Surrounding the 2022 World Cup, Amherst, MA September-December 2022 Project Owner - Analyzed controversies of the Qatar World Cup by conducting Sentiment Analysis, LDA Topic Modeling, Semantic Network, and Pairwise\nCorrelation Analysis on Youtube comments using R - Concluded that the overall sentiment of the comments was negative, main focus of discussion surrounded human rights violations - Used packages tidyverse, quanteda, tidytext, text2vec, LDAvis, and sentimentr to conduct analysis - Extracted 1,391 comments in total from 9 Youtube videos using Youtube API in Python\nMy final conclusions were made on my final poster.\nFinal Poster: Assessing Sentiment Surrounding the 2022 World Cup\nSpring 2022 Machine Learning Project at URI, Kingston, RI Research Assistant - Designed a program in Python that estimated heterogeneous treatment effects using datasets that involve AIDS and breast cancer treatments as a part of my senior dissertation - Implemented different meta learners in my program that could estimate the conditional average treatment effect to identify how to personalize treatment regimes - Gained experience and knowledge in Causal Inference - Discussed methodology weekly with research leader\n\n\nExperience\nSummer 2021 Bora, La Jolla, CA Business Development & Land Acquisition - Compiled data about potential locations using Google Maps - Analyzed aggregated data to determine which locations are the busiest based on area busyness - Company’s goal is to bring to market an app based, self service beach chair rental service stationed at the most popular locations across the country -

Survey respondents who WFH about once a month (0.584 log odds) , WFH about once a week (0.297 log odds), WFH more than once a week (0.291 log odds), and Mainly WFH (0.390 log odds) are all significantly more likely (p < 0.05) to be satisfied with their jobs than survey respondents who never WFH. Additionally, there is evidence from the model results that supports Hypothesis 4. Survey respondents who use technology more than 75% of their total work time per week (−0.350 log odds) are significantly less likely (p <0.05) to be satisfied with their jobs than those who use technology less than 25% of their total work time per week. Hypothesis 3 is not supported based on the model results as ‘2022’ is not statistically different from 0 (−0.050 log odds , 0.70 SE). Interestingly, survey respondents who are Paid by a temporary agency (−0.533 log odds) or Regular, permanent employees (−1.618 log odds) are significantly less likely to be satisfied with their jobs than those who are Independent contractors. Other control variables that are statistically different from 0 at p < 0.05 include age group and Years worked at current job.\nInteraction model: Unfortunately, there is insufficient evidence that supports Hypotheses #2 and #5 as none of the interactions between working from home, the % of time using technology in a work week, and year (pre and post covid) are statistically different from 0 at p < 0.05."

The reason Independent contractor/consultant/ freelance workers have a greater chance of being very satisfied with jobs could be because of how flexible their jobs are. Although their job security may not be as safe as other types of work arrangements, Independent contractor/consultant/ freelance workers are tasked with work that they excel and are interested in, which leads towards the belief that they are more satisfied with their jobs than the other significant work arrangements."

There may initially be a few issues. We hope to have this feature working smoothly soon!"
